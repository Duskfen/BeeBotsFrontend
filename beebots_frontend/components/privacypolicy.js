        Personal data (usually referred to just as &quot;data&quot; below) will only be
        processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing
        a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the
        services offered there. Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
        i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as
        the &quot;GDPR&quot;), &quot;processing&quot; refers to any operation or set of operations
        such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage,
        adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
        transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment,
        or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on
        personal data, whether by automated means or not. The following privacy
        policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope,
        purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data
        either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also
        inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our
        website and improve the user experience which may result in said third
        parties also processing data they collect and control.

          With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail
          below, users and data subjects have the right
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being
              processed, information about the data being processed, further
              information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of
              the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art.
              16 GDPR);
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art.
              17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary
              as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing
              per Art. 18 GDPR;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by
              them and to have the same transmitted to other
              providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe
              that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in
              breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
            </p>
          </li>

        <p>
          In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to
          whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or
          restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18
          GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is
          impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users
          have a right to information about these recipients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right
          to object to the controller&apos;s future processing of their data pursuant
          to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data
          processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.

        <h3>Information about the data processing</h3>
        <p>
          Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked
          as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the
          deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage
          obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.

          <b>Server data</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet
          browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially
          to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record
          the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website
          from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited,
          the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which
          you visited our site. The data thus collected will be temporarily
          stored, but not in association with any other of your data. The basis
          for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
          interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and
          security of our website. The data will be deleted within no more than
          seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary
          purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from
          deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally
          resolved.

          <b>a) Session cookies</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other
          storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These
          cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your
          browser, location data, or IP address. This processing makes our
          website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for
          example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a
          shopping cart function. The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6
          Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect
          data to initiate or process contractual relationships. If the
          processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our
          legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our
          website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. When you
          close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>b) Third-party cookies</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with
          whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or
          improving the features of our website. Please refer to the following
          information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose
          of such third-party collection and processing of data collected
          through cookies.

        <p>
          <b>c) Disabling cookies</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your
          browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have
          already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary,
          depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please
          use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or
          contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent
          so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to
          change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures
          required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If
          you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the
          documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.
          If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the
          functions on our site may be fully usable.

          <b>Order processing</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The data you submit when ordering goods and/or services from us will
          have to be processed in order to fulfill your order. Please note that
          orders cannot be processed without providing this data. The legal
          basis for this processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. After your
          order has been completed, your personal data will be deleted, but only
          after the retention periods required by tax and commercial law. In
          order to process your order, we will share your data with the shipping
          company responsible for delivery to the extent required to deliver
          your order and/or with the payment service provider to the extent
          required to process your payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legal basis for the transfer of this data is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit.
          b) GDPR.

        <p>
          <b>Customer account/registration</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use
          the data you entered during registration (e.g. your name, your
          address, or your email address) exclusively for services leading up to
          your potential placement of an order or entering some other
          contractual relationship with us, to fulfill such orders or contracts,
          and to provide customer care (e.g. to provide you with an overview of
          your previous orders or to be able to offer you a wishlist function).
          We also store your IP address and the date and time of your
          registration. This data will not be transferred to third parties.
          During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for
          this processing of your data, with reference made to this privacy
          policy. The data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide
          your customer account. If you give your consent to this processing,
          Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis for this processing. If
          the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the
          initiation of a contractual relationship with us or to fulfill an
          existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is also
          Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent to the
          processing of your personal data at any time under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR
          with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are
          revoking your consent. The data previously collected will then be
          deleted as soon as processing is no longer necessary. However, we must
          observe any retention periods required under tax and commercial law.
